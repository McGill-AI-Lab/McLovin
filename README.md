## Somes notes for full stack dev : 

☛Choose backend stack: Django, fastAPI?

☛`Pytorch`integration into the website

☛ Critical features of the website: Authentification, Landing Page (main), Inputting of Data, Outputing of Dating

☛ don't forget to add a `.gitignore` file to omit the library dependencies for frontend (`node_modules`)

☛ don't forget to  `npm install` when you pull from the origin so that your local configuration is up to date
